# Positioning Strategy  - Amplified Tech  
### The fast-delivery digital capability partner for SMEs in the AI era

Amplified Tech sits in a unique position between agencies, consultancies and custom dev shops  - and deliberately avoids becoming any of them.

We occupy a new category:

> **Practical, fast-delivery digital capability for SMEs  - built around how they already work, not how a consultancy thinks they should.**

This document explains how we position ourselves in the market, what we stand for, and how we differentiate.

# 1. Our Category

## We are:
### **A Digital Capability Partner for SMEs**  
Fast, practical, AI-accelerated systems, automation and dashboards that replace spreadsheets and manual processes  - delivered in days, not months.

## We are NOT:
- ❌ A traditional software agency  
- ❌ A dev shop  
- ❌ A consultancy selling frameworks  
- ❌ A transformation programme  
- ❌ A productised SaaS platform  
- ❌ A large-scale enterprise integrator  

This clarity protects our speed, tone and value.

# 2. Who We Serve

### **Primary: SME Owners & Directors**  
Sectors include:
- Trades & service businesses  
- Healthcare & specialist providers  
- Professional services  
- Retail & operations  
- Solo operators with huge leverage potential  
- Scale-ups preparing for investment or exit  

### Characteristics:
- Time-poor  
- Running on spreadsheets  
- Growing faster than their systems  
- Don’t know what they need  
- Can’t justify a full tech team  
- Skeptical of agencies & consultants  
- Curious about AI but unclear on where to start  

We meet them exactly where they are.

# 3. The Core Pain Points We Solve

### Functional pains
- Scattered processes across spreadsheets, email and systems  
- Manual admin absorbing hours per day  
- Bottlenecks hidden inside workflow gaps  
- No visibility on margin, performance or throughput  
- Unable to scale without hiring  
- Inconsistent customer experience  
- Lack of automation  
- Data everywhere and nowhere  

### Emotional pains
- “We don’t know what we need.”  
- “We don’t have the time to fix this.”  
- “I wish everything just worked.”  
- “AI sounds great but where do we even start?”  
- “We can’t afford the big guys.”  
- “We’ve outgrown our tools but don’t know the next step.”  

Amplified Tech addresses both.

# 5. Strategic Positioning Statement

**Amplified Tech gives SMEs the systems, automation and visibility they can’t build themselves.  
We deliver digital capability fast  - from websites to internal tools, automation and dashboards  - built around the way the business already works.**

We use AI to accelerate development and amplify existing processes, not to replace people or create complexity.

We sit between large consultancies and ad-hoc freelancers:  
- faster  
- simpler  
- more honest  
- more practical  

And designed specifically for SME realities.

# 6. Competitive Landscape & Differentiators

**Against agencies:**  
- Agencies sell websites and branding.  
- *We build the tools the business actually runs on.*  
- Faster, cheaper, more practical.

**Against consultants:**  
- Consultants talk.  
- *We build.*  
- Free prototypes → fast value → measurable improvement.

**Against freelancers:**  
- Freelancers build what they’re told.  
- *We help SMEs understand what they need.*  
- Strategy + build + automation in one.

**Against SaaS tools:**  
- SaaS forces SMEs into a box.  
- *We build systems around their actual workflow.*  
- No unnecessary features, no subscriptions.

**Against internal hires:**  
- Hiring devs is slow, expensive, uncertain.  
- *We’re on-demand, fast and low-risk.*

# 7. Our Moats (What Competitors Can’t Copy Easily)

### **1. Real SME Workflow Expertise**  
You’ve lived SME operations.  
You instantly see the waste, bottlenecks and hidden processes.  
Most dev shops can’t.

### **2. Radically Fast, AI-Accelerated Delivery**  
Most teams still work slow.  
You work at AI-native speed with learned heuristics from 12+ months of building real production AI systems.

### **3. Free Working Prototype**  
Competitors can’t afford to offer value upfront.  
You can  - and it instantly builds trust.

### **4. Credits Model**  
Simple, flexible, SME-friendly.  
Hard for slower agencies to replicate without exposing their inefficiency.

### **5. Build + Automate + Amplify**  
A complete capability stack.  
No one else in the SME space offers this full arc.

### **6. Tone & Truthfulness**  
Your radical clarity, blunt honesty and no-BS approach make you instantly trustworthy.

### **7. Reusable micro-ERP components**  
You already have repeatable, white-label components for internal tools.  
This gives you speed no one else has.

# 8. When We Win (Best-Fit Scenarios)

We are the perfect fit when:

- The SME is growing and feels disorganised  
- Processes rely on spreadsheets  
- Admin is increasing faster than revenue  
- The team is overworked  
- The owner feels behind on AI  
- The business needs structure before investment/exiting  
- They want results fast, not in months  

These conditions create a “compounding value stack” for every tool we build.

---

# 9. When We Walk Away

We are *not* a fit when:

- The client wants a large, fully custom enterprise system from day 1  
- They require heavy governance or multi-layer sign-off  
- They already have a full tech team and need slow, complex architecture  
- They want a big transformation programme  
- They can’t articulate real problems and refuse to explore them  
- They want perfection before progress  

This protects your speed and delivery quality.

# 10. Summary

Amplified Tech is positioned as:

### **The fast-delivery digital capability partner for SMEs who want clarity, automation and modern tools  - without complexity, cost or delay.**

Build.  
Automate.  
Amplify.  
And do it all in days, not months.
