# 1. Brand Voice & Tone

## Voice Overview
Amplified Tech speaks in a tone that is:
- **Clear**  - no jargon, no hype
- **Practical**  - simple, grounded, real
- **Confident**  - based on experience, not ego
- **Direct**  - we don’t dance around problems
- **Supportive**  - SMEs, not corporates
- **Human**  - conversational, not robotic

We don’t oversell.  
We don’t bullshit.  
We don’t act like a big consultancy.

We tell the truth, deliver fast, and show value clearly.

## Tone Guidelines

### Avoid:
- Long-winded waffle
- Corporate jargon (synergies, leverage, transformation)

- Abstract bullshit that SMEs don’t care about
