# Build  - Amplified Tech
### Websites, Apps & Internal Tools Built Around *Your* Business

Most SMEs don’t need huge enterprise systems.  
They need simple, reliable tools that match how they actually work  - delivered fast, without fuss.

The **Build** pillar focuses on creating the digital foundations of your business:
websites, apps, internal systems, portals and lightweight ERPs designed precisely around your workflows.

# What We Build

## 1. Websites
Fast, modern, conversion-focused websites built in days, not months.

**Examples:**
- Service websites  
- Marketing pages  
- Lead generation sites  
- Booking or enquiry forms  
- Simple CMS-enabled content sites  
- AI-assisted copy and content handling  

**Why it matters:**  
Your website shouldn’t take months or cost more than it earns.  
We build exactly what you need  - clean, fast and effective.

## 2. Internal Tools (Mini-ERP / System of Record)
Most SMEs run on spreadsheets with hidden processes and untracked work.  
We replace that with simple internal systems your team will actually use.

**Examples:**
- Lightweight CRM  
- Job and workflow tracking  
- Quotations → jobs → invoicing flows  
- Customer / supplier portals  
- Inventory or asset tracking  
- Staff scheduling tools  
- Field operations support  
- Team handover tools  

**Why it matters:**  
Better workflow means fewer mistakes, faster turnaround and smoother operations.

---

## 3. Web Apps & Micro-Apps
Small, high-impact tools that solve specific problems quickly.

**Examples:**
- Customer submission portals  
- Booking engines  
- Project tracking apps  
- Field worker mobile tools  
- Internal communication tools  
- Quote builders  
- Digital checklists and audits  

**Why it matters:**  
Apps don’t need to be heavy or expensive  - most can be built in a few days using modern tech + AI acceleration.

---

## 4. Dashboards & Insight Tools
If your data is scattered across spreadsheets, inboxes and systems,  
we build real-time dashboards that show what’s actually happening.

**Examples:**
- Profit & margin dashboards  
- Job throughput and bottleneck dashboards  
- Workload and scheduling visibility  
- Sales and pipeline reporting  
- Operational clarity dashboards  

**Why it matters:**  
When you see everything clearly, you make better decisions.

---

## 5. AI-Assisted Interfaces
Practical AI tools, not hype.

**Examples:**
- AI forms that pre-fill data  
- AI assistants for internal queries (jobs, customers, quotes)  
- AI-generated documents (quotes, reports, invoices)  
- Automated customer replies  
- Job summarisation and daily briefings  

**Why it matters:**  
This gives SMEs the power of enterprise-grade capability  - for a fraction of the cost.

# How the Build Phase Works

### **Step 1  - Discovery & Prototype (Free)**
We sit down with you, understand your workflow, and create a small working tool to prove value.

### **Step 2  - MVP in a Week**
We agree scope and fixed cost.  
Then we build the first usable version.

### **Step 3  - Improve With Credits**
You buy credits when you want to improve, extend or scale.  
You stay in control.
