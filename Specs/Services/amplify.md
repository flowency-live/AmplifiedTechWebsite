# Amplify  - Amplified Tech
### Understand Your Business. Improve Your Business.

Once your systems and automations are in place, **Amplify** adds the visibility, insight and decision support that SMEs almost never have  - but always need.

Amplify is about **clarity**:  
seeing what’s actually happening inside your business, where work is slowing down, where money is leaking, and where the next improvement should be.

This isn’t consultancy theory.  
It’s practical insight delivered through dashboards, metrics, AI-powered analysis and simple tools that show you the truth.

# What Amplify Includes

## 1. Dashboards  
Real-time visibility across your entire operation.

**Examples:**
- Profit & loss snapshots  
- Margin per job / customer / project  
- Team workload + utilisation  
- Job throughput and bottlenecks  
- Lead-to-sale conversion tracking  
- Time-to-invoice and payment cycles  
- Operational KPIs customised to your business  

**Why it matters:**  
Most SMEs run blind.  
Dashboards give you the confidence to make better decisions every day.

## 2. Operational Visibility  
Behind every spreadsheet is a workflow.  
We reveal it.

**Examples:**
- Where work gets stuck  
- Who becomes a bottleneck  
- Which processes cause delay  
- Where handovers break down  
- How long each step actually takes  
- What causes slow cashflow  

**Why it matters:**  
Clarity reveals the truth  - and the truth improves performance.

## 3. Next-Step Insights (AI-Enhanced)
We don’t overwhelm you with data.  
We highlight what you should focus on next.

**Examples:**
- “Jobs delayed over 3 days increased by 18% this week.”  
- “Customer X is consistently low-margin  - here’s why.”  
- “You could save 90 minutes/day by automating these 3 steps.”  
- “Your invoices take 9 days to be paid  - here are the main blockers.”  

**Why it matters:**  
SME owners are busy  - actionable next steps beat dashboards alone.

---

## 4. Process Mapping & Value Flow
We translate your messy workflows into clean, visible flows that identify:

- Waste  
- Delay  
- Rework  
- Bottlenecks  
- Hidden process steps  
- Cost of delay  
- Areas for automation or improvement  

**Why it matters:**  
When you see your business clearly, you can fix it quickly.

## 5. Strategic Capability Support
For SMEs preparing for:

- Scaling  
- Hiring  
- Investment  
- Mergers  
- Exit / sale  

We create:

- Visibility packs  
- Performance data  
- Process clarity  
- Clean operational systems  
- KPI dashboards investors actually understand  

**Why it matters:**  
A business with clear systems + clear visibility is worth more.
