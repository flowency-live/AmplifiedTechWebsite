# Brand Voice  - Amplified Tech

Amplified Tech’s voice is direct, practical and grounded in real experience.  
We speak like someone who has built real things, solved real problems and sat in real businesses  - not like a consultant or a tech vendor.

This document defines how we speak, write and present ourselves across the website, marketing, proposals and conversations.

# 1. Voice Principles

## **1. Direct, Clear and Honest**  
Say the thing simply.  
No jargon.  
No fluff.  
No performance.

**Example:**  
❌ “We empower organisations to leverage digital transformation.”  
✅ “You’re running on spreadsheets. We’ll fix that.”

---

## **2. Practical, Not Conceptual**  
We don’t talk theory.  
We talk about what actually works in a real SME.

**Example:**  
❌ “Our solutions drive efficiencies across organisational value chains.”  
✅ “We’ll automate the admin that slows you down.”

---

## **3. Fast and Confident, Not Hasty**  
Speed is part of our identity  - but it’s born from expertise, not shortcuts.

**Example:**  
❌ “We can build something quickly.”  
✅ “You’ll get a working tool in days, not months.”

---

## **4. Evidence-Oriented Without Saying ‘Evidence-Based’**  
We show the value, the numbers and the clarity  - without sounding like consultants quoting frameworks.

**Example:**  
❌ “We use quantified methodologies to validate impact.”  
✅ “If we can’t measure it, we won’t build it.”

---

## **5. Human. No Ego. No Theatre.**  
We speak like real people who actually care about the result  - not like suits performing expertise.

**Example:**  
❌ “We deliver customer-centric digital transformation roadmaps.”  
✅ “We build the tools that make your day easier.”

---

## **6. Challenging But Supportive (Radical Candour, Without Saying It)**  
We tell the truth, even if it’s uncomfortable  - but always to help the client win.

**Example:**  
❌ “Let’s align on a transformation readiness assessment.”  
✅ “This process is slowing you down  - here’s a better way.”

---

## **7. Amplify Their Way, Not Ours**  
We never imply that we know better.  
We improve *their* way of working  - not impose ours.

**Example:**  
❌ “You should adopt agile, OKRs and product-led teams.”  
✅ “Your current workflow works. Let’s make it smoother, clearer and automated.”

# 2. Tone Characteristics

### **Plainspoken**  
Avoid corporate talk.  
Use everyday language.  
Assume the reader is busy.

### **Confident**  
We know what good looks like.  
We don’t hedge or over-explain.

### **Pragmatic**  
We focus on what moves the needle, not best-practice fluff.

### **Friendly but Firm**  
Warm, but not sugary.  
Honest, but not blunt for the sake of it.

### **Experienced**  
Wisdom without superiority.

# 3. Phrases We Use Often

These reflect the brand:

- “Let’s fix that.”  
- “Here’s the simple version…”  
- “You don’t need complexity.”  
- “Most SMEs run on spreadsheets  - and that’s fine, until it isn’t.”  
- “Let’s build something that actually helps.”  
- “If we can’t see the value, we won’t build it.”  
- “We don’t do transformation theatre.”  
- “Everything you need to run your business  - amplified.”

---

# 4. Phrases We Avoid

These weaken the brand or stray from our identity:

- Transformation / Digital transformation  
- Acceleration frameworks  
- Methodology / Methodologies  
- Optimisation journeys  
- Enterprise-grade  
- Best practice  
- Deliverables alignment  
- Enablement  
- Roadmapping (except rarely)  
- “Explore synergies”  
- “Leverage” (unless we’re joking)

# 5. Sentence Structure & Style Guide

### **Short sentences win.**  
Break long thoughts into clear statements.

### **Prefer verbs over adjectives.**  
Build. Fix. Improve. Automate. Amplify.

### **Always talk about the real world.**  
Example: “Save 3 hours a day.”

### **Use second person (‘you’) heavily.**  
Puts the client in the center.

### **Use ‘we’ sparingly  - but confidently.**  
Only when talking about what we deliver.

### **No jargon unless explaining or simplifying it.**

### **Avoid unnecessary technical detail.**  
Tech is the engine, not the pitch.

---

# 6. Writing Samples

### **Before (consultancy style):**  
“We partner with organisations to deliver transformation at scale through our proven frameworks…”

### **After (Amplified Tech style):**  
“You’re drowning in admin and spreadsheets.  
Let’s replace them with simple tools that speed you up.”

# 7. One-Line Voice Summary
