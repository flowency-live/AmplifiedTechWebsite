# Delivery  - Amplified Tech  
### Fast, practical, outcome-led delivery for SMEs

Delivery at Amplified Tech is built around one goal:  
**get a working system into your hands as fast as possible  - and then improve it in tight loops.**

We do not run long projects, long meetings or complex programmes.  
We deliver value, validate it quickly, then amplify it.

---

# 1. Delivery Principles

### **1. Build fast, validate early**  
The first version exists to prove value, not to be perfect.

### **2. Small scope, big impact**  
We target 1–3 high-value improvements at a time.

### **3. No complexity**  
Every solution is simple, practical and usable immediately.

### **4. You stay in control**  
You call off work using credits  - no retainers, no long engagements.

### **5. Everything is measurable**  
If we can’t measure the value, we don’t build it.

---

# 2. Delivery Phases

There are only three phases:

## **Phase 1  - Free Discovery & Prototype**  
Covered in `discovery.md`.  
You leave with something working.

## **Phase 2  - MVP Build (1 Week)**  
If the prototype is useful, we agree an MVP scope and fixed price.  
This is the moment we commit to delivering something meaningful, fast.

### What the MVP week includes:
- Clarified scope (kept intentionally tight)  
- System design & build  
- Basic UX and UI  
- Integration with spreadsheets, email or existing tools  
- Basic automation (if needed)  
- Light AI augmentation (if it adds value)  
- Initial dashboards (if relevant)  
- Deployment to your environment  
- Real-world usability checks  
- Fixes based on immediate feedback  

At the end of the week, you get:  
**a fully working first version your business can start using immediately.**

---

## **Phase 3  - Improvement & Amplification Cycles**  
Once the MVP is in your hands, the real power begins.

You buy a block of credits (details in `credits-model.md`) and call down improvements whenever you want.

### Typical improvement cycles include:
- Adding new features  
- Removing friction found during real use  
- Automating manual steps  
- Adding AI assistants  
- Connecting systems together  
- Expanding dashboards  
- Improving speed, UX, performance  
- Increasing clarity and visibility  
- Preparing the system for scale or sale  

Each cycle is small, focused and high-value.

---

# 3. Delivery Cadence

Everything we do is built around speed and focus.

### **MVP:** 1 week  
### **Typical improvement cycle:** 0.5–3 days  
### **Typical automation:** 1–3 days  
### **Typical dashboard:** 1–2 days  
### **Integration task:** 1–3 days  

You never wait weeks or months for value.

# 4. What We Deliver (Outputs)

### **MVP Outputs**
- Functional system, automation or tool  
- Clean UI/UX (simple, intuitive)  
- Working integration with your real data  
- Basic reporting or dashboards  
- Deployment instructions or hosting (if required)  
- Simple guide (if needed, often optional)  

### **Improvement Cycle Outputs**
- Additions, fixes and expansions  
- Additional automation  
- New reports or dashboards  
- Process refinements  
- Better UX  
- Better alignment with your workflow  

### **Amplification Outputs**
- Full visibility dashboards  
- Insight & next-step recommendations  
- Bottleneck identification  
- Margin & profitability clarity  
- Automation roadmap  
- Exit / investor insights

# 5. What We Do *Not* Deliver

To keep delivery fast, focused and affordable, we deliberately avoid:

- Heavy enterprise architecture  
- Large-scale custom systems from scratch  
- Multi-month scoping efforts  
- Long steering committee cycles  
- Complex documentation packs  
- Waterfall planning  
- Change-control bureaucracy  
- Big-agency rebrands or marketing programmes  

This is how we stay fast and keep costs low.

---

# 6. Technology Approach

We use:

- Modern web frameworks  
- Lightweight cloud tooling  
- Practical, affordable hosting  
- AI-assisted development  
- No-code & low-code where appropriate  
- Custom code where needed  
- Integrations with existing systems  

Everything is chosen for **speed, stability, maintainability and affordability.**

We avoid anything heavy, expensive or over-engineered.

---

# 7. Quality Approach

Fast doesn’t mean sloppy.

Our quality strategy includes:

- Rapid iteration & feedback loops  
- Real-world testing with your team  
- No unnecessary features  
- Clear usability as a core requirement  
- Avoiding complexity at all costs  
- Keeping code simple, readable and extendable  

You get pragmatic engineering, not academic craftsmanship.

---

# 8. Deployment & Handover

You always have ownership of:

- Code (if custom)  
- Access credentials  
- Configurations  
- Documentation (only when helpful)  
- Any data or structured models  

We do *not* lock you in.  
We build things that can be used, extended or hosted by any competent engineer.

---

# 9. Summary

Delivery at Amplified Tech is built around one simple truth:

**The fastest way to improve an SME is to build something useful and put it in their hands immediately.**

We remove the complexity, reduce the risk, amplify the value  - and keep improving in tight, focused cycles.
