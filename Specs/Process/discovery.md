# Discovery  - Amplified Tech  
### The fastest, lowest-risk way to understand your business and prove value

Our Discovery process is deliberately simple: no long workshops, no expensive consultants, no frameworks.  
Discovery is about **understanding how your business actually works**  - and building something useful right away.

We don’t produce reports.  
We produce clarity and a working prototype.

# 1. What Discovery Is

Discovery is a fast, practical session where we:

- Understand your workflows  
- Identify your biggest sources of waste  
- Map the real operational bottlenecks  
- Expose spreadsheet-driven processes  
- Uncover hidden admin and manual work  
- Clarify what’s slowing down margin, throughput or customer experience  

And then we take it further:

**We build a working prototype  - usually on the same day.**

This isn’t theory.  
It’s hands-on, practical, and focused on proving value early.

# 2. Goals of Discovery

Discovery is designed to:

- Prove what can be built quickly  
- Show tangible value before any commitment  
- Prioritise your highest-impact improvements  
- Demonstrate how AI + automation can help your specific workflows  
- Make good decisions easier for you  
- Ensure every project begins anchored in reality  

We want you to finish Discovery saying:

> “I didn’t realise we could fix this so fast.”

# 3. What You Get

### **1. A Working Prototype (Free)**  
We build something small but meaningful:  
a tool, a dashboard, an automation, or a workflow replacement.

You can use it immediately.

### **2. A Clear View of Your Opportunities**  
We outline where you can gain the most impact:

- Time saved  
- Admin eliminated  
- Increased margin  
- Faster job turnaround  
- Better customer experience  
- Reduced risk / reduced chaos  
- Visibility that changes decisions  

### **3. A Prioritised Plan (Optional)**  
Only if you want it  - a simple, practical, no-jargon view of:

- What to build  
- What it will improve  
- What it will cost  
- What it will return  
- What to do now vs later  

No pressure.  
No upsell.  
Just clarity.

# 4. What Discovery Is Not

Discovery is NOT:

- A long consultancy exercise  
- A multi-week workshop  
- A transformation readiness assessment  
- A “requirements gathering phase”  
- A report you’ll never read  

We don’t waste your time.  
We get to the real problems quickly and start solving them.

# 5. How Discovery Works

## **Step 1  - A Conversation (15–30 minutes)**  
We talk about your business, challenges, and goals.

## **Step 2  - We Look at How You Currently Operate**  
Screenshots, spreadsheets, emails, tools, photos of whiteboards  - whatever you have.

## **Step 3  - Identify the Quickest Win**  
We target the thing that will create the biggest impact in the shortest time.

## **Step 4  - Build a Working Prototype**  
Often in the room; always within 24–48 hours.

## **Step 5  - Show Value**  
You try it.  
Your team sees it.  
Your business feels the difference.

## **Step 6  - Optional: Agree an MVP Build**  
If the prototype proves valuable, you can move to a one-week MVP build.

If not, the discovery is still free  - and you leave with clarity.

# 6. Why Discovery Matters

Most SMEs don’t need “transformation”.  
They need someone who can:

- See the value  
- Quantify it  
- Build something  
- Quickly  

Discovery is how we jump-start that process.

It gets you value early, with zero commitment  - and gives us the insight we need to build the right thing fast.

# 7. Discovery Deliverables Summary

You receive:

- ✔ A working prototype  
- ✔ A value opportunities map  
- ✔ A simple prioritisation of improvements  
- ✔ Suggested MVP scope (if useful)  
- ✔ Confidence in the next step  

You do **not** receive:

- ❌ Long documents  
- ❌ PowerPoint decks  
- ❌ Framework diagrams  
- ❌ Consultancy jargon  

---

# 8. Who Discovery Is For

- SMEs running on spreadsheets  
- Businesses with scattered processes  
- Teams slowed by manual admin  
- Owners who know things could run smoother  
- Scale-ups preparing for growth, investment or exit  
- Solo operators who need leverage without extra staff  

If you aren’t sure what you need  - Discovery is the answer.

---

# 9. Cost

**Discovery is always free.**

Because:  
- It proves value quickly  
- It removes risk  
- It increases trust  
- And if we can’t build something meaningful, you shouldn’t pay us  

You only pay if you choose to take the next step:  
a one-week MVP build or buying credits for improvement cycles.

# 10. Summary

Discovery gives SMEs something they rarely get:

**Clarity, confidence and a working prototype  - all within a day.**

It’s the fastest, lowest-risk way to see what Amplified Tech can do for your business.
