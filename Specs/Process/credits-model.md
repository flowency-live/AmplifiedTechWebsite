# Credits Model  - Amplified Tech  
### Simple, flexible, transparent  - pay only for the improvements you want

Our Credits Model is designed for SMEs who want **full control**, **no long contracts**, and the ability to get improvements whenever they need them.

You buy credits.  
Each piece of work consumes a set number of credits.  
You call off improvements when you're ready.

No retainers.  
No invoices you weren’t expecting.  
No upsells.  
Just clear, predictable work at your pace.

# 1. Why Credits?

SMEs need flexibility.  
Your needs change.  
Your cashflow changes.  
Your priorities change.

Traditional agencies force you into retainers or fixed scopes that don’t match reality.

Our credits system lets you:

- Control your spend  
- Spread work over time  
- Prioritise easily  
- Pause anytime  
- Scale up or down instantly  
- Make small tweaks without a new project  
- Avoid negotiation and paperwork for every improvement  

It’s fast, clean and built for the real world.

# 2. Credit Packs

We offer a simple, predictable set of packs:

### **Small Pack  - 25 credits**

### **Medium Pack  - 50 credits**  
Best for: adding new features, dashboards, integrations, optimisations.

### **Large Pack  - 100 credits**  
Best for: major expansions, new workflows, full dashboards, multi-feature sprints.

### **Enterprise Pack  - 200+ credits (discounted)**  
Best for: scale-ups, ongoing ops, heavy improvements or multi-team usage.

**Credits never expire.**

# 3. How Credits Are Spent

Credits are tied to typical tasks and complexity, not hours.

## **Examples**

### Small (3–8 credits)
- Minor UI change  
- Small automation step  
- Small dashboard tweak  
- Fixing a workflow edge case  
- Adjusting logic or a rule  

### Medium (8–20 credits)
- New dashboard page  
- New automation workflow  
- Adding a feature to a tool  
- Integrating two systems  
- Smart filtering, search, job views  
- Customer notifications  

### Large (20–40 credits)
- Multiple new workflow steps  
- New mini-app  
- Large dashboard with metrics  
- AI assistant for internal use  
- Expanding a tool for another team  

### Extra Large (40+ credits)
- Major new sub-system  
- Multi-step AI logic / automation  
- New module inside a mini-ERP

## This stays consistent, predictable and fair.

# 4. How Credits Work in Practice

## **Step 1  - Identify a change**
You tell us the improvement you want or the problem you’re facing.

## **Step 2  - Estimate**
We tell you the credit cost immediately  - typically 3 to 40 credits.

## **Step 3  - Approve**
You approve (or change, or delay).  
No pressure. No sales pitch.

## **Step 4  - Deliver**
We complete the work fast  - usually in 1–3 days.

## **Step 5  - Review & Iterate**
You test it.  
If it works, great.  
If you want a tweak, it's usually a tiny credit cost.

# 5. What Credits Cover

Credits can be used for anything related to:

- System improvements  
- Automation additions  
- Dashboard enhancements  
- Workflow changes  
- UX improvements  
- Bug fixes  
- Performance upgrades  
- AI assistants  
- Integrations  
- New small or medium features  
- Retrofitting workflows  
- Adding user roles or permissions  
- Improved error handling  
- Better data visibility  

Credits do NOT cover:

- Full new MVP builds (these are fixed price)  
- Third-party costs (hosting, APIs, SaaS subscriptions)

# 6. Why This Is Fairer Than Hourly Billing

Hourly billing punishes speed.  
Credits reward value.

Your business doesn’t care how long something takes  - it cares whether it works.

Credits:

- Eliminate time-padding  
- Reward rapid delivery  
- Keep scope small and focused  
- Encourage iterative improvements  
- Remove negotiation overhead  
- Keep costs controlled  

It’s aligned to SME reality.

# 7. Example Credit Map

Here’s a realistic view of improvements after an MVP launch:

### Week 1  
- Add customer notes → 6 credits  
- Add job statuses → 10 credits  
- Improve dashboard colours → 4 credits  

### Week 2  
- Add WhatsApp notifications → 12 credits  
- Add an AI job summary generator → 18 credits  

### Week 3  
- Add scheduling calendar → 24 credits  

This kind of staged improvement is normal, controlled and effective.
